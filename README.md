# Election_Analysis
Module 3

![Election Analysis](resources/)

Overview of the project:
    We are working on a project to write script to automate election results in a Colorado precenct. We have been tasked with tabulating the number of votes cast and the number and percentage for each candidate. A successful project could lead to a wider roll out of the script.

There were 369,711 votes cast.

Denver county had the largest number of votes>

The breakdown of votes and percentage of votes for each candidate is as follows:
    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (38,855)
    Diana DeGette: 73.8% (306,055)
    Arapahoe: 3.1% (24,801)

The winner was Diana DeGette, her votes were as follows:
    73.8% (272,892)

This script can be easily modified to fit any other election. The following are some changes that may be necessary:
    Additional dependencies may be needed for data files that are not CSV.
    Lines of code that call for "county" data may need to be changed to reflect the geographic measures, such as states or maybe precencts within a county or city.
